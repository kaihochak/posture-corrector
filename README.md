## How it Works

The circuit and code were designed in [tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fPDDIfmBOT8-posture-corrector/editel?sharecode=blZrHIRUCimcMM4FiqfnjUG9VhzqKjdX48mfOHvK6Eo). Using an ultrasonic sensor on the headrest, the distance of the user's head is constantly measured. When a distance threshold is reached, triggered by the user slouching too far, a signal is sent to a buzzer located on the seat, causing the user to be reminded to sit upright.
